# Ansi2Html

This is a shell script that converts Ansi text to HTML. Handy for tools that generate only ANSI output.

For unix, use it via this command: cat inputfile.txt | ./ansi2html.sh > output1file.html

For windows, use it via this command: type inputfile.txt | ansi2html.sh > output1file.html

You can download sh for windows by googling Cygwin64 or mingw64.
